# Overview

This Timer application is my first attempt at using Android Studio and 
creating a mobile application. The process took me about 10 hours in total, most of which 
was spent on learning how to use the Chronometer feature in Kotlin. The result is 
an app where you can start, stop, resume, and reset a timer. 

The app is very simple - it only has two buttons. One of those buttons (the Start/Pause Button is 
dynamic in nature and changes depending on the state of the application. 

As a result of this exercise, I feel more confident in my understanding of the difference and integration of
backend and frontend development. I now understand the basic framework behind creating a maintainable application,
even though I recognize that this program could be refactored to represent more of that understanding. I gained
greater knowledge about using imported libraries for both in Kotlin and app development.

# Future Work

* User can currently reset the time when the timer is not paused. Would like to change that in the future.
* App itself is pretty bare. Could use little tweaks to increase style like shadow, font, and other style changes.
* Could add another feature typical to a timer app.
